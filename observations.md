In what various ways does the servo behave differently than a DC motor?

It moves a lot more slowly, and it moves exacty as much as you want it to. The dc motor would take a second to slow. It is a lot more percice.

What makes the use of a servo more complex (remember that if you were controlling a DC motor with a Pi, you would need to write some code)?

There is a lot more code, you would need to tell it what you want to do. A dc motor you can just put power in it and it starts turning

What applications do you thin servos are appropriate for? Explain.

I think they are more than likly used for things that require precision; an example could be a robot that pushes things around. A dc motor would be far less acurate than a servo, a servo would push the thing the robot is pushing into an exact location.
